# BETO OS — PRODUCT SKILL (v3.0)

## Decision Filter
A feature must improve at least one:
- Retention
- ARPU / upgrade conversion
- Churn reduction
- Support cost reduction
- Operational clarity (better than spreadsheets)

## Subscription Alignment
Every feature must map to tiers and gating rules.
No random exceptions without documented Enterprise override rationale.

## Complexity Ceiling
Avoid feature overload. Prefer modular unlocks.

## Change Control
If a feature increases cognitive load, it must ship with UX simplification or not ship.
