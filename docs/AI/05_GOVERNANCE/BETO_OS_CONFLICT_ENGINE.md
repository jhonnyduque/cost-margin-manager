# BETO OS — CONFLICT RESOLUTION ENGINE

When directives conflict:

1. MASTER_SYSTEM overrides ALL.
2. Security overrides Product.
3. Billing overrides UX.
4. Backend integrity overrides Frontend preference.
5. Long-term scalability overrides short-term speed.

AI must explicitly state when hierarchy was applied.
